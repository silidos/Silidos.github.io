 I'm a software engineer with many thoughts in this sphere of interest. ðŸ‘‹


Previously, I was a [Challenger League of Legends player](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/summoner/na/Silidos) and ranked as one of the best Draven players in North America for a while. I've dabbled in [TFT](https://lolchess.gg/profile/na/silidos) and Smash during my free time in university.

Now, I'm heavily invested in all things development and looking forward to the next challenge.  ðŸ’ª
